Hi all, as you can read this page that means I have completely dropped my old Wordpress blog. Sorry for that if you can't download the code or access the old content anymore. I don't have the code, too. Just forget to backup the code before give the laptop back to the old company. And now all things gone.

Today when I look back, I didn't write anything in last 3 years. A lot of things happened to me. Good things and bad things and I just didn't have any motivation to write anymore. I loved sharing and writing but now the motivation just goes away.

Moreover maintaining a Wordpress CMS platform is not such an easy thing. I need a host, I need to setup the environment, I need to configure things and keep them safe from hacker. It brings a lot of works to me right now.

Therefore I decide to unplug the old one and start a new journey with a static blog platform with Jekyll and Github Pages. The Vietnamese has an idiom "When the old one doesn't go, how the new one can come?". With this new one, I just use it as a place for saving notes. So, there will be no hint, trick, tutorial anymore. Just some notes of mine.

Wish you all a happy and lucky new year 2022. I hope the Corona pandemic will be over in 2022.
